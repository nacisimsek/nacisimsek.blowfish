For over 15 years, I've been a part of the IT and Telecom world. My journey began as a Customer Support Engineer in Nortel Networks and has evolved through roles like Software Engineer, Engineering Team Lead, Project Manager, and Solutions Architect at Huawei. During this time, I've had the chance to work on impactful projects with companies such as Turkcell, Telefonica o2 and Deutsche Telekom.

At Huawei, I not only contributed to sales but also played a pivotal role in designing robust systems and ensuring efficient network solutions. I've been deeply involved with Huawei's SmartCare® Solution, a leading Customer Experience Management product. This experience gave me hands-on expertise in onsite solution delivery, data integrations and management, from solutions like Hadoop and Spark to visualization platforms such as Tableau.

Currently I am working as Technical Account Manager at Ververica, specialized in open source realtime data streaming technologies around Apache Flink, both on-prem and cloud deployed mainly on Kubernetes.

I have an academic degree of Computer Engineering from Ege University and MBA from Bahcesehir University. Beyond these, I hold PMP® and German B1 certifications.

Outside the world of bits and bytes, I do travel with my wife and our lovely british shorthair "Bamboo" and take photos. Doing regular exercise, yoga and meditation also help me find balance.
